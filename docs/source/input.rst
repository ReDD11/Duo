Duo Input file: general structure
=================================



The input file is organized in self-contained input lines (e.g., 
::

     atoms  C H 

specifies the atoms in the diatomic molecule or in input sections beginning with
a specific keyword, e.g., `grid` and ending with the keyword `end`:

::
    
     
     (Defining the integration grid)
     grid
       npoints 501
       range   0.4 8.0
     end


.. note:: The position of the keywords is not important. The input is not key-sensitive, 
          so `atoms`, `ATOMS`, `Atoms` or any other combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters work 
          in exactly the same way.


A comma, a space or a hyphen (minus sign) can all be used as delimiters, so, e.g., one can also
:: 

     Atoms  C, H

Sometimes keywords have several aliases, which are all equivalent.
Lines delimited by parentheses (i.e., round brackets) are ignored and can be used for comments.
If in the input there is a line with one of the keyword `END`, `STOP` or `FINISH` all lines after it are ignored.

Most of the input keywords as well as keyword sections can appear in any order, except for  ``Atoms``, ``States``/``Nstates``, ``POTENTIAL``, ``GRID`` etc
that define other objects and are expected to appear at the top of an input file. In case of a duplicated keyword, the one with the latest appearence takes the 
presedence. 



Here is an example of a Duo inout to compute rovibrational energies of BeH in its ground electronic state using 
a grid-type potential energy curve by of Jacek Koput, JCP  135, 244308 (2011), Table III (see paper_).

Input strucure
--------------


In the following we present the description of the main keywords and options used to define a *Duo* project. 
A Duo ``project`` file can contain any objectst and descriptors used at different stages of the project. Different keys are used to switch neccesary options on and off. 


Srtuctural keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Atoms:  defines the chemical symbols of the two atoms.

Example:
::

    atoms Na-23 H-2

specifies the 23NaD diatomic. Duo includes an extensive database of atomic properties (atomic masses,
nuclear spins, isotopic abundances and other quantities) and will use the appropriate values
when required. The database should cover all naturally-occurring nuclei as well as all radioactive ones
with a half-life greater than one day and is based on the AME2012 and
NUBASE2012 databases. Each atom should be specified by its chemical symbol,
a hyphen (minus sign) and the atomic mass number, like in the example above.
Atomic masses will be used, which is generally the most appropriate choice unless one is explicitely including
non-adiabatic corrections. The hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium can also
be optionally specified by the symbols ``D`` and ``T``.


The atomic mass number can be omitted, like in the following example:
::

     atoms Li F

In this case Duo will use the most-abundant isotopes (7Li and 19F in the example above) or, for
radioactive nuclei not naturally found, the longest lived one. For example 
::

     atoms Tc H

selects for technetium the isotope 97Tc, which is the longest-lived one. A few nuclides in the database are nuclear metastable isomers,
i.e. long-lived excited states of nuclei; these can be specified with a notation of the kind
::

     atoms Sb-120m H


In the example above the radioactive isotope of antimony 120mSb is specified (and hydrogen).
Another example
::

     atoms Sc-44m3 H

specifies the scandium radioactive isotope 44m3Sc (and hydrogen).



* masses:  

This is an optional keyword which specifies explicitely 
the masses of the two atoms (in Daltons, i.e. unified atomic mass units),
overriding the values from the internal database if the keyword \texttt{atoms} is also specified.

For example, the masses for the CaO molecule would be:
::

     masses 39.9625906 15.99491463
     
     
The masses may be atomic masses (the recommended choice if one does not include adiabatic or non-adiabatic corrections), nuclear masses.
An up-to-date reference of atomic masses is provided by the AME2012 catalogue (Chin. Phys. C, 36:1603â€“2014, 2012.)
Duo can also make use of position-dependent masses  (which is a practical way to account for non-adiabatic effects), see Bob-Rot.


* nstates:  is the number of potential energy curves (PECs) included in the calculation.
  
For example, if the ground state and four excited states of a molecule are to be included:
::

    nstates 5

Note that if ``nstates`` is set to a number different from the actual number of PECs  included in the 
input file no error message is issued; if more than nstates PECs are included in the input file then the PECs 
with ``state`` > ``nstates``  will be ignored.  A Duo input file can contain more states and associated objects than required for a current task, with 
``Nstates`` to specify which states should be used. 

Note also that, consistently with the way Duo works internally, ``nstates`` is the number of unique PECs in absence of spin-orbit couplings.

An alternative to ``nstates``, the selection of the electronic states can be made via the `States` list as follows:
:: 
      
      States  X A B a C^Pi

where the strings X, A, B, a and C^Pi are also used to label ``Potential`` Duo objects to identify the corresponding electronic states:
::


      Potenial X
      ......
      end

 
Historically, Duo used numbers to label potentials, which is currently extended to simple strings. 

* jrot: specifies the set of total angular momentum quantum numbers to be computed.

These must be integers or half-integers, depending on whether there is an even or odd number of electrons.
One can directly specify the values (separated by spaces or commas), specify a range of values (a minimum
and a maximum values separated by a hyphen; note than the hyphen must be surrounded
by at least by one space on each side). The values do not have to appear in ascending order.
For example, the following line
:: 
      
      jrot 2.5, 0.5, 10.5 - 12.5,  20.5
     

specifies the set `J = 0.5, 2.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 20.5`.

The first ``J`` in the ``jrot`` list will be used to define the reference zero-point-energy (ZPE) value for the
run.

Note that in the optional sections specifying calculation of spectra (See Intensity) or
specifying fitting (section \ref{sec:fitting}) is necessary to specify again a list of
J values   by ``J`` and ``Jlist`` respectively, which are completely independent from the ``jrot`` value
specified for energy level calculation.


* symmetry:  (or ``Symgroup``) is an optional keywork specifying the molecular permutation-inversion symmetry group.

``Cs(M)`` is for heteronuclear diatomics and ``C2v(M)`` is for homonuclear diatomics. 

For example: 
::

    symmetry Cs(M)

Instead of ``C2v(M)`` one can write equivalently ``C2h(M)`` or ``G4(M)``, as these groups are isomorphic; 
the only difference will be in the labels used for the energy levels.
The short-hand notations ``Cs``, ``C2v``, ``C2h`` and ``G4`` can also be used and are equivalent to the ones with ``(M)``.
The energy calculations are done using ``Cs(M)``, which is also the default, while for the intensities the ``C2v(M)`` group can be also used.
Note that this keyword refers to the symmetry of the exact total (electronic, vibrational and rotational)
Hamiltonian and `not` to the :math:`C_{\infty v}` or the  :math:`D_{\infty h}` point groups, which are relative 
to the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian.



Defining the grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* grid: specifies an input section with the specifications of the grid of points.

It is used for the solution of the vibrational problem.

Example:
::

     grid
       npoints 501
       range 1.48 , 2.65
     end


See :ref:`grids`


Eigensolver
^^^^^^^^^^^

The input section ``EigenSolver`` (aliases: ``FinalStates``, ``diagonalizer``, ``FinalStates``) 
specifies various options relative to the `J>0` and/or the coupled problem; it also specifies
the LAPACK routine which should be used for matrix diagonalization (both for the solution of the
vibrational problem and for the solution of the coupled problem).
Example:
::

    Eigensolver
      enermax 25000.0
      nroots 500
      ZPE 1200.0
      SYEVR
    END

See :ref:`Eigensolver`. 


Vibrational basis and contraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While tje primitive radial basis set is defined by the DVR grid points (see ``Grid``) with the sizes controlled by ``Npoints``, the actual vibratioanl 
basis set is in the solution of the Schroedinger equation as part of the the rovibronic basis set, is constructed as follows. 
As a first step the `J=0` vibration problem is solved for each electronic state, in which the
corresponding Schroedinger equation is solved in the grid representation of ``npoints``. Then a certain number  of the resulted
vibrational eigenfunctions :math:`|v\rangle` with :math:`0 \le v\le` vmax and :math:`\tilde{E} \le` ``EnerMax``  is selected to
form the vibrational part of the basis set.

The contraction type is defined in the section ``CONTRACTION`` (aliases: ``vibrationalbasis`` and ``vibrations``) 
by the keywords ``vib`` or ``omega``. 


    VibrationalBasis             options for the vibrational uncoupled problem
      vmax  10                   compute     vmax vibrational states
    end                          end of vibrational specifications


See :ref:`Contractions`. 


Duo objects
^^^^^^^^^^^


``poten`` (alias: potential) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Duo uses concepts of ``objects`` or ``fields`` of different types to define rhe corresponding curves: potential energy curves (PECs), spin-orbit curves (SOCS), electronic angular momenta curves (EAMs) etc.

For example,  ``potential`` represents a PEC. From the point of view of theory,  each objects, including PEC, is a result of the electronic
structure calculation with clamped nuclei, possibly complemented with the scalar-relativistic correction and with the 
Born-Oppenheimer Diagonal correction (also known as adiabatic correction). Approximate curves can be obtained with well-known quantum chemistry methods such as Hartree-Fock, coupled cluster theory etc and
then refined by fitting to the experiment. Some curves are effective objects that can only be defined empirically (e.g. Bob-rot). See :ref:`Fields` for details. 


Here is an example for a PEC showing the general structure:   
::

      symmetry u
      type  EMO

      B2          0.00000000000000E+00
      end



Duo Fitting
^^^^^^^^^^^

Duo allows the user to modify (`refine`) the potential energy curves and other coupling curves
by least-squares-fit to `experimental` energy term values or wavenumbers. For detaisl see Section :ref:`fitting`. 
Teh fitting is activated via the section ``Fitting``, for example:
::

  FITTING
  JLIST 2.5,0.5, 1.5 - 11.5, 22.5 - 112.5
  itmax 30
  fit_factor  1e6

   0.5   +   1     0.0000  1  0  0   0.5   0.5    100.000
   0.5   +   2   965.4519  1  1  0   0.5   0.5      7.071
   0.5   +   3  1916.8596  1  2  0   0.5   0.5      5.774

   0.5   +   5  3777.5016  1  4  0   0.5   0.5      4.472
   0.5   +   6  4686.7136  1  5  0   0.5   0.5      4.082
   0.5   +   7  5346.1146  2  0  1  -0.5   0.5    100.000
  end


The section can be deactivated by adding the keyword ``OFF`` next to ``FITTING``:
::
 
    FITTING OFF



Intensities and line lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Absorption or emission spectra as well as line lists and other
related quantities can be computed by adding an ``INTENSITY`` section. For details see :ref:`computing-spectra`. 


The ``INTENSITY`` section can be deactivated by adding the keyword ``OFF`` next to ``FITTING``:
::
 
    INTENSITY OFF




Here is an example of its general structure:
::


  intensity
    absorption
    thresh_intens  1e-15
    thresh_coeff   1e-15
    temperature   300.0
    qstat         10.0
    ZPE  931.418890
    selection (rules) 1 1
    J,  0.5, 1.5
    freq-window  -0.001,  25000.0
    energy low   -0.001, 6000.00, upper   -0.00, 30000.0
  end




Eigenfunctions and reduced density
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The computed eigenfunctions and radical reduced densities  can be printed out into a sperate file (checkpoint). 
This option can be enabled via the section ``Checkpoint``:
::

   Checkpoint
    density save
    eigenvectors save
    Filename xxxxx
   End


See :ref:`Eigenfunctions and reduced density`. 


Example: computing energy levels (one PEC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here below there is a commented, minimalistic Duo input file for a single Morse potential; note that the input is case-insensitive.
In this particular example we compute the :math:`J=0` energy levels of a Morse oscillator :math:`V(r) = D_e (1-e^{-a(r-r_e)})^2` 
with :math:`D_e = 40000` cm\ :sup:`-1`,
:math:`r_e =1` Angstrom and :math:`a = 1` Angstrom\ :math:`^{-1}`; the masses of both atoms are both set to 1 Dalton, so that this example
is very approximately corresponds to the hydrogen molecule H:math:`_2`. The exact energy levels are given by 
:math:`E_n = \omega (n+1/2) \left[1 - x_e (n+1/2) \right]`, :math:`n=0, \ldots, 33`,
with :math:`\omega = a \sqrt{2 D_e/\mu} = 2322.593667` cm\ :sup:`-1` and :math:`x_e = \omega / (4 D_e) = 0.01451621`.

Duo will by default echo the whole of the input file in the output between the lines ``(Transcript of the input --->)`` and
(``<--- End of the input``). This is useful so that the ouput file will also contain the corresponding input.
To avoid echoing the input just add the keyword ``do_not_echo_input`` anywhere in the input file (but not within an input section).

*  Duo will then print its logo, the values of the physical constants (used by the program for such things as conversions between different units)
   and print some of the global input parameters such as the number of grid points, extent of the grid etc.

*  Duo will then print the values of all objects (PECs, dipole moment curves, couplings) on the internal grid. For PECs Duo will also
            compute and print quantities such as the value of the first few derivatives at the minimum, the corresponding equilibrium
            spectroscopic constants (harmonic frequency, rigid-rotor rotational constant etc.).

*  Duo will solve the :math:`J=0` one-dimensional Schroedinger equation for each of the PECs and print the corresponding 
   ``vibrational (contracted)`` energies.

*  Duo will then solve the full problem (with :math:`J >0` and/or all coupling terms activated). 
   In the example above we specified two values of :math:`J`, namely :math:`J=0` and :math:`J=10`. The :math:`J=0` 
   energies will be exactly the same as the ``vibrational (contracted)`` ones, as in our example there are no couplings at all.

Control keys
------------

The following keys can appear anywere in the input file but outsides any sections. 

* ``ASSIGN_V_BY_COUNT`` 


(*Default*)
The vibrational quantum number :math:`v` is assigned by counting the rovibronic states of the same ``State``, :math:`\Lambda`, 
:math:`\Sigma` arranged by increasing energy. The corresponding ``State``, :math:`\Lambda`, 
:math:`\Sigma` labels are defined using the largest-contribution approach 
(the quantum labels corresponding to the basis set contribution with the largest expansion coefficient).   
The keyword should appear anywhere in the body of the input file. This is the default option. An alternative is to use the largest-contribution  
approach also to assign the vibrational quantum number (``ASSIGN_V_BY_CONTRIBUTIO``), which is used for all other quantum numbers. 


* ``ASSIGN_V_BY_CONTRIBUTION``

The vibrational quantum numbers  is to use the largest-contribution  approach also to assign the vibrational quantum number (opposite to ``ASSIGN_V_BY_COUNT``). 
The largest contribution approach is used for all other quantum numbers.


* ``Print_PECs_and_Couplings_to_File``

This keyword will tell Duo to print out all curves to a separate, auxiliary file. 

* ``Print_Vibrational_Energies_to_File``

This keyword is to print out all vibrational energies into a separate, auxiliary file. 

* ``Print_Rovibronic_Energies_To_File``

This keyword is to print out all rovibronic energies into a separate, auxiliary file.  

* DO_NOT_ECHO_INPUT is switch off the printing the inout file at the beginning of the output. 

* ``Do_not_Shift_PECs``

By default the PECs are shifted such that the minimum of the first PEC is at zero. This leads to Zero-Point-Energy (ZPE) to be 
defined relative to this zero.
All rovibronic energies are by default defined relative to the ZPE. This keyword will suppress shifting PECs so that ZPE is on the absolute scale. 

The default is to do the shift of the PECs to the minimum of  ``poten 1``. In order to suppress shifting  energies to ZPE, use
::

   ZPE 0.0

see also the description of the keyword ``ZPE``.




* ``DO_NOT_INCLUDE_JS_COUPLING``

This option is to switch the JS coupling in the Hamiltonian, can be used for debugging purposes. 

* ``ASSIGN_V_BY_COUNT``

This keyword will switch off the default assigning method  (based on the largest basis set contribution) of the vibrational to simple 
counting of the states, starting from :math:`v=0` within the same rotational-electronic configuration :math:`|{\rm State}, \Lambda, \Sigma, \Omega \rangle`. 
The default method  to assign the states with vibrational quantum numbers is known to fail at high excitations. 

* ``Legacy`` 

Aliases: ``Old-Version``, ``Version xxxx`` (xxxx is the year). This keyword to switch to the original, older version of the molpro function, 
which was modified in 2019 (bugs fixed and restructured). This keyword should help to reproduce the results published 
with the old version of the code. 
    

* ``L2Convention``

There are two conventions to include the electronic angular momentum :math:`\hat{L}_z^2` components: 
it can be defined either as part of the kinetic energy operator (``SPECIFY_L^2``, ``SPECIFY_L**2``,``Default``)
as :math:`\Lambda^2` or as part of the :math:`\hat{L}^2`  operator (``SPECIFY_LX^2_PLUS_LY^2``,``SPECIFY_LX**2_PLUS_LY**2``).

Example:
::

    L2Convention SPECIFY_LX^2_PLUS_LY^2


* ``Mem,``, ``Memory``: defines the maximal memory (RAM) available for the calculations.  

The program will stop with an error if the memory will be acceded before attempting to allocate a new array. The memory can be specified in 
``B``, ``Kb``, ``Mb``, ``Gb`` or ``Tb``. Example: 
::

    64 Gb 
    
    
* SOLUTIONMETHOD * defines the DVR basis set and thus the DVR solution method for the vibrational problem. 

Possible methods include ``5POINTDIFFERENCES``.
:: 
     
     SOLUTIONMETHOD  5POINTDIFFERENCES
     

for the 5 points stencil finite differences to derive the kinetic energy operator. A more efficient method is Sinc DVR (default), which is switched on with
::

    SOLUTIONMETHOD  SINC

Since Sinc is also currently the default method, this does not have to be specified.
